# Coding styles and coverage

- Yapf with default options must be run before submitting any PR
- A bug must exist on tracker, and it must be mentioned in each commit in the form \[4\] COMMIT\_MSG
- Use conventional commits ( https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/ )
- You can use emojis on commits

# Testing

Make sure you test anything before submitting a PR, and please, do not lower
the coverage levels

# Notes

This is all subjective, and most PRs wich add any value will be probably
merged. Don't be afraid to contribute!

Artwork, testing (are you using pyrcrack on an opensource project? Give me a
note!), etc are also good contributions.
